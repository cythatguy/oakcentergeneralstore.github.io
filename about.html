    <p>The Oak Center General Store is the home of Folk Forum, a concert series thats been run here since the 80s. 
        The series is organized into two "seasons" a year: fall/winter and winter/spring. Each season will have an accomponying newsletter.
    <br> <br>We like to focus on music somewhere within the "folk" tradtion, but not always. <br><br> The music usually starts at 7:30 pm and goes for 2 hours (two 45 min acts with a 15 min intermission) 
<br><br>Doors open at 6:30. There is free coffee/tea, playing cards, and lots of books to encourage mingling and relaxation before the show. <br><br> 
While Folk Forum got its start in the 80s, music and performance at the General Store goes back long before that. The structure was built in 1913 as two story building with a general store on the first level and a performance hall on the second. While the original struture has been added on to considerably, the original store and performance hall has largly remained the same. This makes for a one of kind listening experience and some challenges -- which bring me to my next point. 
<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Accessibility:</span> Our bathrooms on the first and second floor are not handicap accessable. <br><br> The only way to reach the performance hall is by staircase. We do however play the music live on the main floor. tickets are only required for guests who go upstairs. <br><br> Parking is along the road we are situated, this can make for a long walk depending on how many people come to the show. If you for whatever reason would not wish to make this trek park your car in front of the store with your hazards on and ask the person at the counter for a valet.
