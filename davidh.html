    <h4>The Talent</h4>
    <p>David Huckfelt is a midwestern folksinger who has been involved in the increasingly desperate fight to stop the construction of Line 3, a tar-sands pipeline that would cut across Minnesota. His new single, “Book of Life,” is dedicated to “the Indigenous water protectors standing up and speaking out for Mother Earth all across Turtle Island.” - bill mckibben, the new yorker <br>
      When the world's on fire and the seeds of division are sown throughout the land, music and ceremony have always  held a sacred space for healing and renewal.  Room Enough, Time Enough, only the second full-length solo record from singer-lyricist & folk activist David Huckfelt of The Pines, is a record about restoring balance: space and attention, peace and equality, redeeming the marginalized, and remembering the forgotten.  It's a new expression of the ancient ritual and power of songs to weave a web of resilience and protection over our land, our loves, and our resistance, from a songwriter whose new solo endeavor is a present-moment plea for connection and compassion.

“The phrase ‘Room Enough, Time Enough’ comes from a name the Navajo used to describe their ancestral homeland in northern Arizona and New Mexico, not far from where the record was made”, Huckfelt says.  “It’s one of the most breathtaking and beautiful places in the country, where a person can hear themselves not-think, a place where every mesa and every rock is a god with a name and power.  We are fortunate to even be allowed to pass through this land.  Places like this are a paradox of vulnerability and resilience, and the geography of the desert is where and how this record was born.”  Featuring a collection of new original material seamlessly entwined with folk songs from deep in the American soil, “Room Enough, Time Enough” draws inspiration from such powerful protest records as Johnny Cash’s “Bitter Tears” and Floyd Red Crow Westerman’s “Custer Died For Your Sins”; records that open a trap door to a different version of America, and speak out against oppression while holding fast to beauty for beauty’s sake. 

 In an all-out effort to find common ground, Huckfelt’s friendships with a beautiful and diverse cast of musical voices across genres, including singular but oft-ignored Native American songwriters, form the basis of the new work.  “I’m not Native, but for me, it wouldn’t be a stretch at all to say that Indigenous thought, spirituality, and friendships spared me from being a casualty on the rocks of American Christianity.  It’s an undeserved mercy I long to repay in some way.  For this record, I wanted to bring storytellers and voices that we have forgotten how to listen to into unison, without falling into nostalgia or idealism,” Huckfelt says. “The idea is to build a wider tent and a longer table for collaboration across genre, race, class, with songs like Woody Guthrie said don’t “tell you that you’re born to lose” - songs that can help lead to healing and positive solutions.  And  just to let everyone be as wild and real as they are at heart.”  The record and the songs are primarily about protecting the spirits of vulnerable people and places, whosoever & wheresoever they may be.  “I tried to bring together every strange, beautiful voice on the edges of the musical garden I live in; unlikely combos, unlikely people, unlikely songs, and urgent messages that have the power to help break the dark spell  American has been under,” says Huckfelt.  “A record of spirit protection.”
